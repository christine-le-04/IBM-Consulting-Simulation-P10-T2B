/**
 * Runs a workspace walkthrough once per learner.
 *
 * Two things decide whether it opens. The account level flag says whether this
 * learner is being onboarded at all, so an account that predates onboarding
 * never sees a walkthrough. Per tour progress then says which of the
 * walkthroughs this particular learner has already been through, so arriving
 * at a workspace for the first time still explains it even after the earlier
 * ones are done.
 *
 * Completion is recorded when the tour closes rather than when it opens. A
 * learner who is interrupted half way through has not been onboarded, and
 * marking them as such on open is the difference between missing it once and
 * losing it permanently.
