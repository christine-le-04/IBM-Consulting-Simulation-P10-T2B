# IBM AI-Powered Consulting Simulation

RMIT Capstone × IBM — RPG-style consultant training platform.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + IBM Carbon |
| Backend | Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.x (modular monolith) |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector |
| AI | IBM watsonx.ai Granite |
| Auth | JWT (OIDC-ready) |

## Quick Start (Local Dev)

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop
- Node 20+
- (Java 21 + Gradle are only needed if you want to run the API outside
  Docker — the recommended workflow below doesn't require them.)

### 1. Clone and configure
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set JWT_SECRET (openssl rand -hex 64) and your Supabase
# Postgres credentials (SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL/USERNAME/PASSWORD).
```

### 2. Start the backend (containerized)
```bash
docker compose up -d
# API:     http://localhost:8080
# Swagger: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
# Health:  http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/liveness
```
This builds a multi-stage, layered Docker image for the Spring Boot API
(see `apps/api/Dockerfile`) and starts it with all required environment
variables loaded automatically from `.env` — no manual `./gradlew bootRun`,
env exporting, or port-conflict juggling needed. The database is remote
Supabase Postgres, so no local Postgres container is started.

`redis` / `kafka` are scaffolded for future phases and are **not** started
by default; run `docker compose --profile extended up -d` if you need them.

### Observability

The API emits structured JSON logs to stdout and Prometheus metrics from a
protected Actuator endpoint. Start the separate local stack with:

```bash
docker compose --profile observability up -d --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Grafana | http://localhost:3001 |
| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090 |
| Loki | http://localhost:3100/ready |

Grafana provisions Prometheus and Loki automatically. Useful Loki queries:

```logql
{service="consulting-simulation-api", event="AUTHENTICATION_REJECTED"}
{service="consulting-simulation-api", event="HTTP_REQUEST_COMPLETED"} | json | latencyMs > 1000
{service="consulting-simulation-api"} | json | requestId="<request-id>"
```

Every HTTP response includes `X-Request-ID`; use it to correlate frontend
failures with API logs. AI metrics use the `consulting_ai_provider_*` prefix
and only low-cardinality provider/task/outcome/fallback labels.

On Railway, stdout JSON appears immediately in the API service Deploy Logs.
Set a strong `OBSERVABILITY_TOKEN` secret on the API before configuring a
separate Prometheus service to scrape `/actuator/prometheus`. Keep Grafana,
Prometheus, and Loki as separate services; the application container has no
vendor-specific log or metric transport.

### Railway Team Observability

The repository includes production deployment roots under
`observability/railway/`. Deploy the four services in the **same Railway
project and environment**:

| Railway service | Repository root | Public? | Persistent volume |
|---|---|---:|---|
| API | `apps/api` | Yes | N/A |
| Loki | `observability/railway/loki` | No | `/loki` |
| Prometheus | `observability/railway/prometheus` | No | `/prometheus` |
| Grafana | `observability/railway/grafana` | Yes | `/var/lib/grafana` |

Give each service the fixed `PORT` shown below. This makes Railway private
network references stable and avoids hard-coded public endpoints:

```dotenv
# API
PORT=8080
OBSERVABILITY_TOKEN=<generate-a-long-random-secret>
LOKI_ENABLED=true
LOKI_PUSH_URL=http://${{Loki.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{Loki.PORT}}/loki/api/v1/push

# Loki
PORT=3100
LOKI_RETENTION_PERIOD=336h

# Prometheus
PORT=9090
API_METRICS_TARGET=${{API.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{API.PORT}}
OBSERVABILITY_TOKEN=${{API.OBSERVABILITY_TOKEN}}
PROMETHEUS_RETENTION_TIME=15d

# Grafana
PORT=3000
PROMETHEUS_URL=http://${{Prometheus.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{Prometheus.PORT}}
LOKI_URL=http://${{Loki.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{Loki.PORT}}
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=team-admin
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<generate-a-strong-unique-password>
GF_USERS_ALLOW_SIGN_UP=false
GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=false
```

`OBSERVABILITY_TOKEN` and `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD` must be Railway secrets.
Do not create public domains for Loki or Prometheus. Generate a domain only for
Grafana, then share its authenticated URL with teammates. Their useful Explore
query is `{service="consulting-simulation-api"}`; add
`| json | requestId="<X-Request-ID>"` to trace one failed browser request.

Swagger is already protected by the normal API authentication scheme and is
available online at `https://<api-public-domain>/swagger-ui.html`. Generate a
public API domain in Railway if one does not already exist, then share that URL
with the team. The OpenAPI JSON is at `/api-docs`.

### 3. Run the frontend (native, hot reload)
```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
# Web: http://localhost:3000 (Vite proxies /api to localhost:8080)
```

### Transactional email and account recovery

Registration creates an inactive-to-login account until its email address is
confirmed. The API issues a high-entropy, single-use verification credential;
only its SHA-256 digest is persisted. Password-reset credentials use the same
pattern, expire after 15 minutes by default, and are invalidated after use.

Configure the following values in local `.env` or as Railway service variables:

```dotenv
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxx
RESEND_FROM=IBM Consulting Simulation <no-reply@mail.ibm-simulator.com>
RESEND_REPLY_TO=support@mail.ibm-simulator.com
APP_PUBLIC_WEB_URL=https://your-web-domain.com
```

Verify `mail.ibm-simulator.com` in Resend and set `RESEND_FROM` to an address
on that domain before production delivery. Never commit an API key. If a key
is exposed, revoke it in Resend and create a replacement.

The web flow is available at `/verify-email`, `/forgot-password`, and
`/reset-password`. Product-facing copy and HTML are centralized in
`apps/api/src/main/java/com/ibm/consulting/sim/shared/email/template/TransactionalEmailTemplates.java`;
the Resend adapter only transports the rendered message.

The additive `V38` migration marks all existing users as already verified, so
deploying this capability does not interrupt current learner or administrator
accounts.

### Everyday workflow
Once set up, day-to-day development is just:
```bash
docker compose up -d      # backend (idempotent — only rebuilds on change)
cd apps/web && npm run dev
```
To rebuild the API image after a backend code change:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build api
```

### Optional: containerized frontend (prod-build parity check)
```bash
docker compose --profile containerized-web up -d --build web
# Web: http://localhost:3000 (nginx-served production build)
```

## Corpus-Backed Client Intelligence

Long-form client research is a governed scenario corpus, not an unconstrained
model completion. Authors upload material only to a DRAFT scenario through
`POST /api/v1/admin/scenarios/{scenarioId}/documents`, then publish the
revision through the normal scenario workflow. Use one document collection per
research lane:

| Learner lane | Knowledge collection |
|---|---|
| Company news | `RESEARCH_COMPANY_NEWS` |
| Stakeholder profile | `RESEARCH_STAKEHOLDER` |
| Financial signal | `RESEARCH_FINANCIAL` |
| Technology indicator | `RESEARCH_TECHNOLOGY` |

Each lane must contain 4-6 authored paragraphs with 180-320 words in total.
Across Company News, Stakeholder, Financial and Technology this gives learners
approximately 1,000 words of scenario-specific material. Separate paragraphs
with blank lines; ingestion preserves each as a research passage and records
its chunk UUID. The reader serves this approved corpus immediately with a chunk
ID attached to every selectable paragraph. AI enrichment is optional and is
rejected unless every paragraph cites approved lane chunk IDs and covers every
required passage. Lanes outside this contract retain the compact fact-grounded
source deck, so no source is padded from sparse scenario data.

## Module Boundaries

Each module follows `api → application → domain ← infrastructure`.  
Domain code has zero Spring/JPA dependencies.
